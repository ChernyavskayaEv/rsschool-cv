### Short history about me

I have worked in the power industry all my life. I climbed the career ladder from engineer to chief engineer, but at the age of 40 I decided to change my life and start everything from scratch. I want to change the field of work and become an IT developer. I think my previous work experience will help me achieve my goal in a short time.

Assembled, balanced, competently organize the workflow. I have experience in personnel management. I know how to focus on the task at hand to achieve the result. I have a high capacity for work and an analytical mindset.
